**A hands-on introduction to quantum computing and writing your own quantum programs with Python**

## What is this book about?
IBM Quantum Experience is a platform that enables developers to learn the basics of quantum computing by allowing them to run experiments on a quantum computing simulator and a real device. This book will explain the basic principles of quantum mechanics, the principles involved in quantum computing, and the implementation of quantum algorithms and experiments on IBM's quantum processors. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
Explore quantum computational principles such as superposition and quantum entanglement
Become familiar with the contents and layout of the IBM Quantum Experience
Understand quantum gates and how they operate on qubits
Discover the quantum information science kit and its elements such as Terra and Aer
Get to grips with quantum algorithms such as Bell State, Deutsch-Jozsa, Grovers algorithm, and Shor's algorithm
How to create and visualize a quantum circuit
